Introduction:

Our fitness application is called KTFit, it aims to encourage people of all ages to start getting into fitness. We want to motivate customers to compete with friends to reach goals, track progress, and keep hydrated. The application should be able to keep track and display the user’s number of steps per day, number of minutes they have been active, cardiovascular workout logs, and have the ability to add friends to see their workouts. Our application will track activities including walking, running and cycling. The metrics tracked for workouts will be distance covered, duration, and speed of the workout session. 

Users will have the ability to track water and caffeine intake while providing daily reminders if they have not input their totals. A workout planner is available to plan workouts and view upcoming events that they have saved. We will assume that a user’s phone is in their pocket to count their steps correctly. We assume that the water and caffeine count provided by the user is correct. A technical requirement of our application is that it will work on Android 10 and older.
